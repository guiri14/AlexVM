# AlexVM

AlexVM is a simple 16-bit CPU emulator based on a made up spec.  There isn't much guidance here, outside of following and learning the fetch, decode, and execute cycle.  It is capable of reading in and executing binary files that conform to the spec.  In addition, there is limited tooling that provides the ability to execute a test program (in TestFile.h) as well as write this test program to a binary file.
